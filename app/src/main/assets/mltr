$Emmm...$ $Hmmm$
$Yeah...ah$
$Uhmm...$ $Hmmm$
$Hiding from the$ $rain and snow$
$Trying to forget$ $but I won't let go$
$Looking at a$ $crowded street$
$Listening to my own$ $heart beat$
$So $many $people$ $all ar$ound $the world$
$Tell me$ $where do I find$ $someone$ $like you girl$
$Take me to your heart$ 
$Take me to your soul$
$Give me your hand$ $before I'm old$
$Show me what love is,$ 
$Haven't got a clue$
$Show me that wonders$ $can be true$
$They say$ $nothing lasts$ $forever$
$We're only here today$
$Love is now or$ $never$
$Bring me$ $far away$
$Take me to your heart$ $...$
$Take me to your$ $soul$
$Give me your hand and$ $hold me$
$Show me what$ $love is,$ $be my guiding star$
$It's easy$, $take me to your heart$
$Standing on a mountain high$
$Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky$
$I should go and$ $see some friends$
$But they don't really$ $comprehend$
$Don't need too much talking,$
$Without saying$ $anything$
$All I need is$ $someone,$
$who makes me$ $wanna sing$
$Take me to your heart$ 
$Take me to your soul$
$Give me your hand$ $before I'm old$
$Show me what love is,$
$Haven't got a clue$
$Show me that$ $wonders$ $can be true$
$They say$ $nothing lasts$ $forever$
$We're only here today$
$Love is now or$ $never$
$Bring me$ $far away$
$Take me to your heart $...$
$Take me to your soul$
$Give me your hand and$ $hold me$
$Show me what love is,$
$Be my $guiding star$
$It's easy$, $take me to your heart$
$Take me to your$ $heart$
$Take me to your soul$
$Give me your hand and$ $hold me$
$Show me what love is,$ $be my guiding star$
